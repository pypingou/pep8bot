pep8bot
-------

A bot that cleans up your code, `PEP8
<http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ style.

Status:  *Pre-Alpha*.

It is a webapp that monitors github repositories you subscribe it to.  When new
commits are pushed, it forks and clones and runs a special version of
PythonTidy on them.  If any changes are made, it pushes and submits a pull
request which you can choose to merge or not.

It is written in Python on the Pyramid framework, and uses `velruse
<http://velruse.rtfd.org>`_ to talk with github.  It adds a webhook callback
back to itself on repositories you ask it to monitor.  When one of those
callbacks fire, pep8bot adds a work item to a redis queue with `retask
<http://retask.rtfd.org>`_.

A separate worker process picks tasks off the redis queue to perform the
fork, clone, tidy, push, pull-request work flow.

TODOs
-----

 - Move secret_oauth_token from githubsecrets.py to development.ini like a
   normal person.
 - Clean up the webapp UI/UX.
 - Make PythonTidy configurable so users can set their style-preferences.
 - Page to tweak pythontidy parameters.. characters per line, etc.
 - Host it all somewhere under http://pep8.me/
 - turn all on, turn all off buttons.
 - "log" page, showing last however many runs and their output
 - Handle pushes and pull requests both.. i.e., comment on a pull request saying
   "these commits are PEP8 OK" or "these commits are not PEP8 compliant".
 - Fork and distribute PythonTidy on pypi
 - Clean up PythonTidy.  It's a little old a rusty.
 - Support Python2 and Python3 simultaneously.

Hacking
-------

If you run into trouble with these instructions, feel free to open a ticket
or get in touch with me directly.

Fork and clone the following two repositories:

 - http://github.com/ralphbean/pep8bot
 - http://github.com/ralphbean/PythonTidy

Using `virtualenvwrapper <pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper>`_::

  $ cd pep8bot
  $ mkvirtualenv pep8bot
  $ python setup.py develop
  $ initialize_pep8bot_db development.ini

Go off and `register your development application with github
<https://github.com/settings/applications>`_.  Save the oauth tokens and add the
secret one to a new file you create called ``pep8bot/githubsecrets.py``::

    secret_oauth_token = "SECRET_STRING_GOES_HERE"

If you do not have a redis daemon installed or working already you will need to
install it and start it::

  # yum install redis
  # systemctl start redis

Now, in two different terminals, start the webapp and the worker process.  In
the first::

  $ workon pep8bot
  $ pserve development.ini --reload

In the second::

  $ workon pep8bot
  $ python pep8bot/worker.py development.ini
